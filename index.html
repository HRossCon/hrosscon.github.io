<h1>Hunter's D&amp;D page</h1>

<p>Welcome, adventurers! I'm Hunter and I work at a small public library in 
Kentucky.  I first got started with Dungeons &amp; Dragons at work.  We started
a D&amp;D club for kids and I learned how to play the game.  Not long after I 
learned to play, I became a Dungeon Master (DM) for our club!  Now I play 
in several games at home while still acting as DM for our library D&amp;D 
programs.</p>

<p><b>Author's Note:</b> This HTML page is a project for my LIS 636 class.  
With this class, I hope to understand the basics of computing and information 
technology and be able to use that knowledge in my career in information 
science.  I also hope to take more LIS classes that focus on computing, 
databases, and information architecture, so I hope to use the fundamentals I 
learn in this class to help me in my future courses.</p>

<h2>What is D&amp;D?</h2>
<p>D&amp;D is a tabletop role-playing game where players create characters and 
go on adventures.  Players describe the actions they want their characters to 
perform and then roll special dice to decide what happens. The game is overseen 
by a person known as the Dungeon Master, or DM for short.  The DM's role is to 
determine what happens to the players' characters based on their abilites and 
the outcome of the dice rolls.  The DM also controls any non-player characters 
(NPCs) and the monsters and villains the players fight.</p>

<p>The players' characters go on many adventures designed by the DM.  One 
adventure might have the players exterminate a horde of zombies in an undergound 
crypt while the next might involve finding a lost magical artifact of immense 
power.  It's all up to the creativity of the DM.  As characters complete 
objectives and defeat enemies, they level up, gaining new powers and abilities 
that allow them to face more dangerous threats.  Many adventures make up an 
overarching campaign which might last for months or years of real time.  
Adventuring is inherently dangerous, however, and player characters can be 
killed by powerful foes or dastardly traps.  When this happens, a player can 
create a new character.  If all the player characters die, it is known as a 
total party kill (TPK) and might signal the end of one campaign and the start 
of a new one.</p>

<h2>Class Options</h2>
<p>Every player character in D&amp;D has at least one class.  A character's 
class determines what weapons and armor they can use, what spells they can cast 
(if any), and any special abilities they might have.  The table below lists the 
classes available in the SRD.</p>
